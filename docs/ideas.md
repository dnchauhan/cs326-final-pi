Innovative Idea
    Our project idea is to make a space for users to have their own personal recipe library. The application will allow users to save food recipes, share them with others, and see what other users have similar tastes.

Important Components
    The application will allow users to find recipes through an API and save it to their profile. The data that will come with recipes include data for recipe names, ingredients, recipe image, and user likes. Users can also find other users by their username or by food compatibility. They can interact with others by viewing profiles and liking recipes.
